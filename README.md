# Task-Scheduling-in-Heterogeneous-Computing-Environments

# Project Name

This study provides valuable insights into the efficacy of task scheduling algorithms in heterogeneous computing environments, enabling informed decision-making to enhance resource allocation, minimize task completion times, and improve energy efficiency.
## Installation

For installing the E2C simulator check the Ali's Repository (https://github.com/Ali-Mokhtari/E2C-Sim), after installing the simularot you can use the V folder from my repository instead of the orginal one. 
## Usage

Examples of how to use the project, along with relevant code snippets or screenshots.


## E2C Simulator

[E2C](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11333) is a visual simulator for heterogeneous computing systems. It allows you to study system-level solutions, measure energy consumption, and explore scheduling methods. The intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) makes it easy to experiment with different configurations.

Developed by Ali Mokhtari and Mohsen Amini Salehi from the HPCC Laboratory at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.
